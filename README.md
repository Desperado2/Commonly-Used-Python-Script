## 常用的一些Python脚本合计
#### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.

优美胜于丑陋

Explicit is better than implicit.

明了胜于晦涩

Simple is better than complex.

简洁胜于复杂

Complex is better than complicated.

复杂胜于凌乱

Flat is better than nested.

扁平胜于嵌套

Sparse is better than dense.

间隔胜于紧凑

Readability counts.

可读性很重要

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

即便假借特例的实用性之名，也不可违背这些规则

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

不要包容所有错误，除非你确定需要这样做

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

当存在多种可能，不要尝试去猜测

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

而是尽量找一种，最好是唯一一种明显的解决方案

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

虽然这并不容易，因为你不是 Python 之父

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than right now.

做也许好过不做，但不假思索就动手还不如不做

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

如果你无法向人描述你的方案，那肯定不是一个好方案；反之亦然

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

命名空间是一种绝妙的理念，我们应当多加利用
